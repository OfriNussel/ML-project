# ML-Final Project
As the culminating project of my Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University's 'Digital Sciences for High-Tech' program, I delved into the intricate analysis of executable files. This involved crafting a predictive model to discern the potential for malicious intent within these files.

Navigating a binary classification challenge, I categorized files as either malicious (1) or benign (0) based on their diverse attributes. While some attributes were identifiable, others remained enigmatic.

Working with a dataset of 60,000 instances, each labeled as malicious or non-malicious, I rigorously analyzed and preprocessed the data. This meticulous process led to the selection of an optimal model capable of uncovering patterns within unseen test data.

The culmination of these efforts resulted in a notable AUC score of 0.91 during testing, earning a project evaluation score of 95. Comprehensive documentation, including code and detailed insights, is encapsulated within a Python-Markdown Jupyter Notebook.
