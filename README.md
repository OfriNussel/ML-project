# ML-Final Project
During my studies in the 'Digital Sciences for High-Tech' program at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Engineering, I conducted my final project in a machine learning course. Throughout the course, we learned data handling, structuring, and utilized various ML models for classification and prediction.

Our final project involved a dataset of 60,000 rows, representing individual documents. The primary aim was to classify document malignancy using diverse classification models.

The model we selected achieved an impressive 0.91 AUC score on the test data, resulting in a project score of 95! This project was an enriching experience, offering valuable insights into machine learning model deployment.

All project details, including code and comprehensive insights, are documented within a Python-Markdown Jupyter Notebook
